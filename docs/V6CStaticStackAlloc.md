# V6C Static Stack Allocation (O10)

Static stack allocation replaces the dynamic stack frame of non-reentrant
functions with a statically-allocated global memory region in BSS.

On the Intel 8080, accessing a stack slot requires computing the address at
runtime (`LXI HL, offset; DAD SP` — 24cc, 4B). With static allocation, the
address is a link-time constant and can be accessed directly via `SHLD`/`LHLD`
(20cc, 3B) or `STA`/`LDA` (16cc, 3B). The stack frame prologue and epilogue
are eliminated entirely.

## Motivation

The 8080 has no indexed addressing. Every stack-relative access must compute
`SP + offset` into HL, which clobbers a register pair and costs 24+ cycles.
A function with 4 spill slots across 3 calls can spend **100+ cycles** just on
address computation for the stack frame.

The c8080 compiler already uses static allocation for all local variables by
default (since non-reentrant code is the norm on 8-bit platforms). O10 brings
this optimization to v6llvmc, but with safety analysis to preserve correctness
for reentrant and interrupt-driven code.

## Usage

Static stack is **enabled by default**. To disable:

```sh
# via Clang
clang --target=i8080-unknown-v6c -O2 -mllvm -mv6c-no-static-stack -S file.c

# via llc
llc -march=v6c -O2 -mv6c-no-static-stack < file.ll
```

When disabled, no analysis runs and all functions use the normal SP-relative
frame.

## Eligibility Criteria

A function qualifies for static allocation only when all five conditions hold:

### 1. `norecurse` attribute

The function must be marked `norecurse`, meaning it never calls itself
(directly or transitively). At `-O2`, LLVM's `PostOrderFunctionAttrs` pass
infers this automatically when all callees have visible bodies.

**Important:** `norecurse` alone is NOT sufficient — it only means "doesn't
call itself." A `norecurse` function can still be **re-entered** by an
interrupt handler while it is executing. See the interrupt criteria below.

### 2. Not an interrupt handler

The function must **not** have the `"interrupt"` attribute. Interrupt handlers
are invoked asynchronously by hardware — if their frame were static, a nested
interrupt (or a re-trigger after EI) could corrupt it.

### 3. Not reachable from any interrupt handler

Even if a function is not an interrupt handler itself, it can be **called from
one** (directly or transitively). Consider:

```
main() → foo() → bar()
                   ↑
ISR()  → helper() ─┘
```

Here `bar()` is `norecurse` and is not an ISR, but it IS reachable from `ISR`
through `helper`. If `main` is in the middle of `bar()` and the interrupt
fires, `ISR → helper → bar` would re-enter `bar` — corrupting the static
frame.

The pass computes this with a **module-wide BFS** starting from every function
with the `"interrupt"` attribute. All functions discovered by the BFS are
marked as interrupt-reachable and excluded from static allocation.

### 4. Address not taken

If a function's address is taken (`&func` in C), it could be stored in a
function pointer and called from interrupt context in a way the compiler
cannot see. Such functions are excluded conservatively.

### 5. Has frame objects

The function must have at least one non-fixed, non-dead frame object (local
variables or spill slots). Functions that don't need a stack frame gain
nothing from this optimization.

## The `interrupt` Attribute

The V6C backend recognizes the standard LLVM `"interrupt"` function attribute
to identify interrupt service routines (ISRs). In C, mark a function as an
ISR using `__attribute__((interrupt))`:

```c
// Declare a function as an interrupt handler.
// The compiler will:
//   - Exclude it from static stack allocation (criterion 2)
//   - Exclude all its direct/transitive callees (criterion 3)
//   - Skip SP-trick optimization inside it (V6CSPTrickOpt)
__attribute__((interrupt))
void timer_isr(void) {
    // Handle timer tick
    tick_count++;
}
```

### How the compiler uses it

The `"interrupt"` attribute affects two optimization passes:

1. **V6CStaticStackAlloc** — The pass scans every function in the module.
   Any function with `hasFnAttribute("interrupt")` becomes a BFS seed. The
   BFS then walks the call graph (via `CallBase` instructions) to find all
   transitively reachable callees. Both the ISR itself and every reachable
   callee are excluded from static allocation.

2. **V6CSPTrickOpt** — The SP-trick (repurpose SP as a fast read pointer)
   is disabled inside ISR functions because SP manipulation inside an ISR
   would corrupt the interrupt return stack.

### Examples

```c
// Helper called from both normal code and ISR.
// Will be detected as interrupt-reachable via BFS → no static stack.
void update_counter(void) {
    counter++;
}

__attribute__((interrupt))
void vsync_isr(void) {
    update_counter();   // BFS reaches update_counter from here
}

void main_loop(void) {
    update_counter();   // Same function, also called from main
    // ...
}
```

```c
// A leaf function only called from main — never from any ISR.
// Will get static stack if it has spills (enabled by default).
__attribute__((noinline))
int compute(int a, int b, int c) {
    int x = a + 1;
    int y = b + 2;
    int z = c + 3;
    use_val(x);         // y, z must survive → spill slots
    use_val(y);
    use_val(z);
    return x + y + z;
}
```

### What the compiler does NOT do (yet)

The V6C backend does **not** currently generate special ISR prologue/epilogue
sequences (save all registers, return via `EI; RET`). The `"interrupt"`
attribute is currently used only as a **safety marker** for optimization
decisions. ISR entry/exit code should be written in inline assembly or a
separate `.asm` file for now.

### Why `norecurse` alone is not enough

A concrete example of the re-entrance problem:

```c
__attribute__((noinline))
void foo(void) {
    int local = get_val();  // spill slot allocated
    use_val(local + 1);
}

__attribute__((interrupt))
void timer_isr(void) {
    foo();                  // Re-enters foo while main's call is suspended!
}

void main(void) {
    foo();                  // foo is executing here...
    // Timer interrupt fires mid-execution of foo
    // ISR calls foo again → static frame corrupted
}
```

`foo()` is `norecurse` (it doesn't call itself), but it IS reentrant because
the ISR can invoke it while `main`'s invocation is suspended on the stack.
Without the BFS analysis from ISRs, a naïve implementation would assign a
static frame to `foo` and produce silent data corruption.

## norecurse Inference

For LLVM to infer `norecurse` at `-O2`, the `PostOrderFunctionAttrs` pass
must see the bodies of all callees. This requires:

- **Single translation unit:** All called functions defined in the same `.c`
  file, or
- **LTO (Link-Time Optimization):** `-flto` merges all translation units
  before the attribute inference pass runs

External function declarations (without bodies) block `norecurse` inference
for all their callers. Workarounds:

```c
// Option 1: Provide visible bodies (noinline prevents unwanted inlining)
__attribute__((noinline))
void helper(int x) { /* body visible */ }

// Option 2: Manually annotate if you know it's safe
__attribute__((leaf))
extern void external_helper(int x);

// Option 3: Use LTO
// clang -flto --target=i8080-unknown-v6c -O2 file1.c file2.c -o out
```

## Pass Architecture

### Pipeline position

`V6CStaticStackAlloc` runs in `addPostRegAlloc()` — after register allocation
(which determines spill slot count and layout) but before PrologEpilogInserter
(which would emit SP-adjustment code for the frame).

### Per-function global variables

Each eligible function gets its own BSS symbol:

```
@__v6c_ss.heavy_spill = internal global [4 x i8] zeroinitializer
@__v6c_ss.compute     = internal global [6 x i8] zeroinitializer
```

The symbol name is `__v6c_ss.<function_name>`, sized to exactly the function's
frame size. Frame indices are mapped to byte offsets within this region via
`V6CMachineFunctionInfo::addStaticSlot()`.

### Frame elimination

When `eliminateFrameIndex` encounters a spill/reload pseudo-instruction and
the function has static stack info, it emits direct memory access instead of
SP-relative computation:

| Pseudo | Register | Static expansion | Cycles | Bytes |
|--------|----------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| `V6C_SPILL16` | HL | `SHLD addr` | 20 | 3 |
| `V6C_SPILL16` | DE | `XCHG; SHLD addr; XCHG` | 28 | 5 |
| `V6C_SPILL16` | BC | `PUSH HL; LXI HL, addr; MOV M,C; INX HL; MOV M,B; POP HL` | 68 | 7 |
| `V6C_RELOAD16` | HL | `LHLD addr` | 20 | 3 |
| `V6C_RELOAD16` | DE | `XCHG; LHLD addr; XCHG` | 28 | 5 |
| `V6C_RELOAD16` | BC | `PUSH HL; LXI HL, addr; MOV C,M; INX HL; MOV B,M; POP HL` | 68 | 7 |
| `V6C_SPILL8` | A | `STA addr` | 16 | 3 |
| `V6C_RELOAD8` | A | `LDA addr` | 16 | 3 |
| `V6C_LEA_FI` | HL | `LXI HL, addr` | 12 | 3 |

Compare with SP-relative for a non-HL 16-bit spill (worst case):
`PUSH HL; LXI HL, off; DAD SP; MOV M,r; INX HL; MOV M,r; POP HL` = **76cc, 9B**

Static HL spill: **20cc, 3B** — saves **56cc and 6B per operation**.
