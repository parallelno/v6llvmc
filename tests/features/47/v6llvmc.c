/* O54: Optimal stack adjustment via PUSH/POP for small frames.
 *
 * Goal: produce a function with a small (2- or 4-byte) hardware
 * stack frame so the prologue/epilogue's LXI+DAD+SPHL sequence is
 * exercised. Calling an opaque `extern` (without `nocallback`)
 * keeps `worker` ineligible for V6CAllocaPromote / V6CStaticStackAlloc
 * (O10), and holding multiple i8 values across the calls forces a
 * register spill.
 *
 * Compile (no extra flags needed under -O2):
 *   llvm-build\bin\clang.exe -target i8080-unknown-v6c -O2 -S \
 *       tests\features\47\v6llvmc.c -o tests\features\47\v6llvmc_new01.asm
