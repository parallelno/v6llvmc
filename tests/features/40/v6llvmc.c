// Test case for O61 Stage 6: non-A i8 spill sources.
//
// Stage 6 extends O61 from Stage 4's A-only i8 spill source filter
// to any GR8 spill source (B, C, D, E, H, L also admitted). The
// reload-side machinery (MVI r, 0 for any GR8 target) is unchanged
// from Stage 4; Stage 6 reuses O64's shared expandSpill8Static
// helper to emit the spill ladder against a Sym+1 code-address
// target.
//
// Compile:
