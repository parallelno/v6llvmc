Designed feature: Inline assembly | Supported | 8080 syntax via `asm()` | wasn't implemented. This is the report.

Created temp_asm_test.c

The error is: "Inline asm not supported by this streamer because we don't have an asm parser for this target". This is expected — V6C doesn't have an asm parser (MC-level), and inline asm in the .s output requires the asm printer to handle inline asm directives which depends on an asm parser.

The constraint resolution (getConstraintType, getRegForInlineAsmConstraint) works at the LLVM IR level for inline asm lowering, but the actual asm emission in the AsmPrinter fails because there's no MC asm parser. This is a known limitation. The inline asm test should use -emit-llvm to verify constraint handling works at the IR level, or we can test it through llc with the --stop-after flag.

Actually, let me test if it works at the IR level:

IR generation with inline asm works — "=a" constraint is accepted. The assembly emission through -S crashes because there's no asm parser, but that's a known limitation that would be an entire milestone to fix (implementing a full V6C MC asm parser). The lit test for inline asm should test at the IR level.
