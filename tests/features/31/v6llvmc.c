// Test case for O60: Commutable ALU Operand Selection
//
// Demonstrates the shuffle pattern that arises when a commutative 8-bit
// ALU operation is selected with its operands placed in registers such
// that the LHS (A) and RHS (GR8) mapping forces extra MOVs.
//
// The compiler should pick, for each commutative op (+, &, |, ^),
// whichever operand ordering requires fewer copies.
//
// Layer 1 (isCommutable + TwoAddressInstructionPass): covers sum_xx.
// Layer 2 (ISel A-aligned LHS pref): covers cases where both live past op.
// Layer 3 (post-RA AccPlanning commute): covers spill-induced residuals.
