# Vector 06c LLVM Backend — Implementation Plan

**Reference**: [design.md](design.md) (authoritative, fixed)

---

## 1. Scope & Conventions

### 1.1 Purpose

This document translates the approved design into an ordered, test-driven implementation sequence. It defines milestones, dependency chains, validation criteria, and documentation checkpoints. The design is not modified or reinterpreted here.

### 1.2 Toolchain Dependencies

| Tool | Path | Role |
|------|------|------|
| `v6emul` | `tools/v6emul` | CLI Vector 06c emulator — executes flat binaries, inspects registers/memory, counts cycles |
| `v6asm` | `tools/v6asm` | CLI 8080 assembler — reference assembly syntax, ASM→ROM conversion, intermediate output comparison |
| LLVM source | `llvm-project/` | Full LLVM monorepo (cloned at pinned `llvmorg-18.1.0`, **gitignored** — build reads from here) |
| LLVM mirror | `llvm/` | Git-tracked mirror of all V6C-related changes (V6C target dir + modified upstream files) |
| Mirror sync | `scripts/sync_llvm_mirror.ps1` | Copies changes from `llvm-project/` → `llvm/` after each build |
| CMake ≥ 3.20 | System | Build system |
| Ninja | System | Build executor |
| Python 3 | System | LLVM lit test runner, test harness scripts |

### 1.2.1 Source Mirror Workflow

`llvm-project/` is gitignored because it is a large upstream clone. All V6C-related source is git-tracked under `llvm/`, which acts as a mirror.

**After every successful build**, run:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\sync_llvm_mirror.ps1
```

The script syncs:
- `llvm-project/llvm/lib/Target/V6C/` → `llvm/lib/Target/V6C/` (full directory mirror)
- Individual modified upstream files (e.g. `Triple.h`, `Triple.cpp`) → corresponding paths under `llvm/`

When a milestone modifies new upstream files, add `xcopy` lines to `scripts\sync_llvm_mirror.ps1`.

If `llvm-project/` is re-cloned, restore changes by copying from `llvm/` back into `llvm-project/`.

### 1.3 Status Markers

Each milestone, step, and test block uses these markers:

- `[ ]` — Not started
- `[~]` — In progress
- `[x]` — Complete
- `[!]` — Blocked (with explanation)

### 1.4 Branch Strategy

Each milestone is implemented on a feature branch (`milestone/M<N>-<short-name>`) and merged to `main` only after all tests in that milestone pass. This enables bisect-friendly history.

## 2. Implementation Difficulties & Mitigation Strategies

This section catalogues foreseeable implementation difficulties — distinct from the runtime/performance risks in design §15 — and the concrete strategies to resolve them.

### 2.1 LLVM Upstream Complexity

**Difficulty**: LLVM's backend API surface is vast (~200 classes involved in target registration, ISel, MC emission). Documentation is sparse for out-of-tree targets. API breakage across LLVM releases is common.

**Strategy**:
- Pin to a single LLVM release tag (e.g., `llvmorg-18.1.0`) for the entire development cycle. Do not chase `main`.
- Use the AVR backend as the primary reference implementation — it is the closest existing analogue (8-bit, similar register scarcity, no alignment requirements).
- Secondary references: MSP430 (16-bit, simple ISA), RISCV (clean modern backend, good TableGen patterns).
- Build and test incrementally: each milestone adds the minimum C++ to make a new subset of `llvm-tblgen` / `llc` / `llvm-mc` work correctly, validated before moving forward.
- Maintain a local `docs/LLVMAPIJournal.md` noting every non-obvious API usage, parameter meaning, and workaround discovered during implementation.

### 2.2 TableGen Learning Curve & Debugging

**Difficulty**: TableGen is poorly documented, errors are cryptic, and the relationship between `.td` records and generated C++ `.inc` files is opaque. Incorrect instruction descriptions silently produce wrong code.

**Strategy**:
- Start with the absolute minimum: 5 instructions (NOP, MVI, MOV, ADD, HLT) in M2. Validate encoding byte-by-byte against `v6asm` output before adding more.
- Use `llvm-tblgen --print-records` to dump the parsed TableGen database and diff it against expectations.
- Write one FileCheck encoding test per instruction *as it is added* — never batch instruction definitions without tests.
- Keep `.td` files small and separated (formats, registers, instructions, schedule) per design §4.1 to isolate errors.

### 2.3 Accumulator-Centric ISA vs LLVM's Register Model

**Difficulty**: LLVM's SelectionDAG and register allocator assume a general-register architecture. The 8080's mandatory routing through register A for all ALU operations is not naturally expressible and can cause the allocator to produce incorrect or excessively spilled code.

**Strategy**:
- Model A as an implicit def/use on every ALU instruction in TableGen from the start. Do not attempt to hide this from the allocator.
- Implement and test `i8` ALU operations first (M4), focusing exclusively on correct register allocation with the A constraint, before adding `i16` expansion.
- Defer the `V6CAccumulatorPlanning` optimization pass (M8) until the basic pipeline is fully correct. Correctness first, then performance.
- Use the AVR backend's handling of dedicated registers (e.g., `R0`/`R1` for multiply results) as a pattern.

### 2.4 16-bit Operation Synthesis

**Difficulty**: The 8080 has no general 16-bit ALU (only `DAD` for `HL += rp`). All other 16-bit arithmetic must be synthesized from 8-bit operations with carry propagation. The interaction between type legalization (expand `i16` → two `i8`) and the register allocator's pair constraints is a known source of subtle bugs in 8-bit backends.

**Strategy**:
- Implement `i16` as `Legal` in type legalization (use register pairs), but expand most `i16` operations to 8-bit sequences in custom lowering. This avoids LLVM's generic expansion which does not understand register pairs.
- `DAD` is the only natively legal 16-bit operation — handle it as a special case via a custom DAG combine (design §5.4).
- Test every `i16` operation in isolation: `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `xor`, `shift`, `compare`. Each gets a dedicated lit test *and* an emulator round-trip test via `v6emul`.
- Implement pseudo-instructions (`V6C_ADD16`, `V6C_SUB16`, etc.) that expand post-RA, so the register allocator sees clean pair operands.

### 2.5 Stack Frame Access Cost

**Difficulty**: Every stack slot access requires an `LXI H, N; DAD SP; MOV A,M` sequence (32cc+). If the register allocator spills aggressively, trivial functions become extremely slow. Incorrect SP-relative offset computation causes memory corruption that is extremely hard to debug.

**Strategy**:
- Implement frame lowering (M5) with extensive offset-correctness tests: functions with 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 255, 256 bytes of locals. Verify via `v6emul` that stack memory is read/written at the correct addresses.
- Inflate spill weights early (M5 frame lowering) so the allocator avoids spilling whenever possible.
- Implement prologue/epilogue shrink-wrapping for leaf functions from the start — this is the single highest-impact optimization for generated code quality.
- Write a dedicated stress test: a function with more live variables than registers, verify correct spill/reload via emulator.

### 2.6 No Standard Object File Format

**Difficulty**: LLVM's MC layer and LLD assume ELF/COFF/MachO. The Vector 06c needs flat binaries. The MC layer needs custom `MCObjectFileInfo`, `MCAsmBackend`, and `MCCodeEmitter` that produce raw bytes, which is not a well-trodden path.

**Strategy**:
- In M3 (MC layer), start with assembly-only output. Validate ASM text against `v6asm` reference output.
- Add binary emission (M6) as a separate milestone. Use a minimal custom `MCObjectFileInfo` that defines a single monolithic section.
- Validate binary output byte-by-byte: compile a known program, compare the `.bin` against `v6asm`-assembled reference, then run both in `v6emul` and compare execution traces.
- Defer the linker (M10) — single-file compilation to flat binary is sufficient for all milestones until then.

### 2.7 Testing Without Real Hardware

**Difficulty**: The Vector 06c is vintage hardware. All correctness and performance validation must happen in emulation. Emulator fidelity bugs could mask compiler bugs.

**Strategy**:
- Use `v6emul` as the primary oracle. Cross-validate early results against `v6asm`-assembled hand-written programs to establish emulator trust.
- Write a "golden test suite" of 10–15 hand-assembled programs (via `v6asm`) with known register/memory outcomes. Run these in `v6emul` before trusting the emulator for compiler output validation.
- For cycle counting, use `v6emul`'s cycle counter output. Establish baseline cycle counts for reference programs in M1 and track regressions throughout.

### 2.8 Clang Integration Breadth

**Difficulty**: Registering a new target in Clang touches `TargetInfo`, `TargetCodeGenInfo`, driver, triple parsing, and built-in macros. Missing any hook causes silent miscompilation or crashes.

**Strategy**:
- Defer Clang integration to M9, after the backend is fully functional via `llc` (LLVM IR → assembly/binary).
- Use the AVR Clang integration as a template — it covers the same freestanding/bare-metal pattern.
- Validate with a minimal C program: `int main() { return 42; }`. Must compile to correct binary, run in `v6emul`, and halt with 42 in register A.
- Add intrinsics (`__builtin_v6c_in`, etc.) one at a time, each with a C test that compiles and runs.

### 2.9 Runtime Library Bootstrap

**Difficulty**: The runtime library (`crt0.s`, math, shift, memory) must be written in 8080 assembly and must conform to `V6C_CConv`. If the calling convention implementation has bugs, every runtime call will silently corrupt state.

**Strategy**:
- Write and test runtime functions *before* the compiler emits calls to them. Assemble with `v6asm`, test with `v6emul` in isolation.
- Create a standalone test harness per runtime function: set up arguments in the ABI-specified registers/stack, call the function, verify results.
- Only after each runtime function passes its standalone test, wire it into the compiler's LibCall table.
- Keep the runtime minimal — design §11 lists exactly the required functions. Do not add anything speculative.

### 2.10 Optimization Pass Interaction & Phase Ordering

**Difficulty**: Custom passes (AccumulatorPlanning, XchgOpt, ZeroTestOpt, SPTrickOpt, etc.) interact with each other and with LLVM's built-in passes. Phase ordering bugs cause one pass to undo another's work, or worse, create invalid MachineFunction state.

**Strategy**:
- Implement all custom passes as individually toggleable (`-v6c-disable-<pass-name>`), defaulting to ON.
- Each pass gets its own milestone (M8) with isolated before/after FileCheck tests confirming the pass transforms what it should and nothing else.
- Run the full lit test suite with each pass individually disabled to catch ordering dependencies.
- Use LLVM's `-verify-machineinstrs` flag in all test runs to catch MachineFunction invariant violations immediately.

| 6 | Create the emulator golden test suite: 10–15 hand-written `.asm` programs with known outcomes. Assemble via `v6asm`, run via `v6emul`, verify results. Store in `tests/golden/`. | `[x]` |
| 7 | Set up CI configuration (or local Makefile target) that runs `v6asm` + `v6emul` golden tests. | `[x]` |

#### M0.2 Tests

---

### M1 — Target Registration & Skeleton
`[x]` **Status: Complete**

**Goal**: Register `V6C` as an LLVM experimental target. After this milestone, `llc -march=v6c -version` prints the target name and `llvm-tblgen` processes an empty target description.

#### M1.1 Steps

| # | Step | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Create `V6CTargetInfo.h/.cpp` in `TargetInfo/`. Register the target triple `i8080-unknown-v6c` via `RegisterTarget`. | `[x]` |

| 3 | Create `V6CSubtarget.h/.cpp`. Stub all accessors (`getInstrInfo()`, etc.) to return `nullptr` or assert. | `[x]` |
| 4 | Create top-level `V6C.td` with an empty target definition. Verify `llvm-tblgen` parses it. | `[x]` |
| 5 | Create `CMakeLists.txt` for the V6C target. Wire into LLVM's build via `LLVM_EXPERIMENTAL_TARGETS_TO_BUILD`. | `[x]` |
| 6 | Build LLVM with V6C enabled. Verify `llc -march=v6c -version` lists the target. | `[x]` |

#### M1.2 Tests

| Test | Tool | Validates |
|------|------|-----------|
| `llc -march=v6c -version` exits 0 and prints target name | `llc` | Target registration |
| `llvm-tblgen V6C.td` exits 0 | `llvm-tblgen` | TableGen skeleton valid |
| CMake configure with `-DLLVM_EXPERIMENTAL_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=V6C` succeeds | `cmake` | Build integration |

#### M1.3 Verification

- `llc --version` output includes `v6c` in the registered targets list.
- Data layout string matches design §2.2 exactly.

#### M1.4 Documentation

- `[x]` `docs/V6CBackendOverview.md` — update with build instructions for V6C target.

---

### M2 — TableGen: Registers & Core Instructions
`[x]` **Status: Complete**

**Goal**: Define all registers (design §3) and the full 8080 instruction set (design §4) in TableGen. All instruction encodings validated against `v6asm` reference output.

#### M2.1 Steps

| # | Step | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Create `V6CRegisterInfo.td`. Define all physical registers (A, B, C, D, E, H, L, SP, FLAGS, PC), register pairs (BC, DE, HL, PSW), sub-register indices (`sub_hi`, `sub_lo`), and all register classes from design §3.2. | `[x]` |
| 2 | Create `V6CRegisterInfo.h/.cpp`. Implement `V6CRegisterInfo` subclass: reserved registers (SP, PC), allocation order, callee-saved list (empty per design §6.1). | `[x]` |
| 3 | Run `llvm-tblgen -gen-register-info` → `V6CGenRegisterInfo.inc`. Verify generated register enum, classes, and sub-register tables. | `[x]` |
| 4 | Create `V6CInstrFormats.td`. Define encoding formats: `Implied`, `Reg`, `Imm8`, `Imm16`, `Direct`, `RST`, `IO` per design §4.3. | `[x]` |
| 5 | Create `V6CInstrInfo.td`. Define **all** 8080 instructions organized by category (design §4.2). Start with data-move (MOV, MVI, LDA, STA, LDAX, STAX, LXI, LHLD, SHLD), then ALU (ADD, SUB, ADC, SBB, ANA, ORA, XRA, CMP + immediate variants), then increment/decrement, rotate, branch, stack, misc, and I/O. Include `let Defs = [FLAGS]` / `let Uses = [A]` as appropriate. | `[x]` |
| 6 | Create `V6CSchedule.td`. Define `SchedMachineModel` and `SchedWriteRes` entries for every instruction class with Vector 06c cycle costs. | `[x]` |
| 7 | Create `V6CInstrInfo.h/.cpp`. Implement `V6CInstrInfo` subclass with `copyPhysReg()`, `storeRegToStackSlot()`, `loadRegFromStackSlot()` stubs. | `[x]` |
| 8 | Run `llvm-tblgen -gen-instr-info` → `V6CGenInstrInfo.inc`. Verify all instruction enums exist. | `[x]` |
| 9 | For every instruction, compare its encoding (opcode byte + operand structure) against the byte produced by `v6asm` for the same mnenomic. Document discrepancies and fix. | `[x]` |

#### M2.2 Tests

| Test | Tool | Validates |
|------|------|-----------|
| `llvm-tblgen -gen-register-info V6C.td` exits 0 | `llvm-tblgen` | Register descriptions parse |
| `llvm-tblgen -gen-instr-info V6C.td` exits 0 | `llvm-tblgen` | Instruction descriptions parse |
| `llvm-tblgen -gen-subtarget V6C.td` exits 0 | `llvm-tblgen` | Scheduling model parses |
| `llvm-tblgen --print-records` shows expected register classes and members | `llvm-tblgen` | Register class correctness |
| Encoding reference test: compile list of all opcodes, diff against `v6asm`-produced bytes | `v6asm` + script | Opcode encoding correctness |

#### M2.3 Tests — FileCheck (lit)

Create `tests/lit/MC/V6C/encoding.s`:
- One `CHECK` directive per instruction mnemonic verifying the encoded byte(s).
- Covers all 256 possible opcodes (valid ones check encoding; undefined ones check for error).

#### M2.4 Verification

- `llvm-tblgen --print-records` output contains exactly the register classes from design §3.2 with correct members.
- Every defined instruction's opcode matches the Intel 8080 reference and `v6asm` output.
- Scheduling costs match the Vector 06c timing table from the design prompt.

#### M2.5 Documentation

- `[x]` `docs/V6CInstructionTimings.md` — instruction timing table, cross-referenced with TableGen `SchedWriteRes` names.

---

### M3 — MC Layer: Assembly Emission
`[x]` **Status: Complete**

**Goal**: `llc` accepts LLVM IR and emits syntactically correct 8080 assembly text. The assembly output is consumable by `v6asm`.

#### M3.1 Steps

| # | Step | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Create `MCTargetDesc/V6CMCAsmInfo.h/.cpp`. Set comment string, directive syntax, label conventions compatible with `v6asm` syntax. | `[x]` |
| 2 | Create `MCTargetDesc/V6CMCTargetDesc.h/.cpp`. Register `MCAsmInfo`, `MCInstrInfo`, `MCRegisterInfo`, `MCSubtargetInfo` factory functions. | `[x]` |
| 3 | Create `V6CAsmPrinter.h/.cpp`. Implement `AsmPrinter` subclass: `emitInstruction()` delegates to `V6CMCInstLower`. | `[x]` |
| 4 | Create `V6CMCInstLower.h/.cpp`. Lower `MachineInstr` → `MCInst` — translate virtual register operands to physical register names. | `[x]` |
| 5 | Create `V6CTargetObjectFile.h/.cpp`. Define section layout (`.text`, `.data`, `.rodata`, `.bss`). | `[x]` |
| 6 | Wire `V6CPassConfig::addInstSelector()` to minimal V6CISelDAGToDAG with RET pattern. | `[x]` |
| 7 | Test: hand-craft `MachineFunction` with a few instructions, run through `V6CAsmPrinter`, validate output matches `v6asm` syntax expectations. | `[x]` |
| 8 | Test: write a trivial `.ll` file (empty function with `ret void`), run `llc -march=v6c`, verify assembly output is syntactically valid. | `[x]` |

#### M3.2 Tests

| Test | Tool | Validates |
|------|------|-----------|
| `llc -march=v6c trivial.ll` produces `.s` file | `llc` | Assembly printer works |
| Assemble `llc` output with `v6asm` — no syntax errors | `v6asm` | Output is valid assembly |
| Assembly output contains `ORG` directive matching default start address | `FileCheck` | Start address config |
| lit tests: `tests/lit/CodeGen/V6C/trivial.ll` — verify `RET` instruction appears | `llc` + `FileCheck` | Basic emission |

#### M3.3 Verification

- `llc` output for `ret void` contains a syntactically valid `RET` instruction.
- `v6asm` successfully assembles the `llc` output into a `.bin`.
- Assembly syntax (mnemonics, operand format, directives) matches `v6asm`'s expectations.

#### M3.4 Documentation

- `[x]` `docs/V6CBuildGuide.md` — update with `llc` usage examples.

---

### M4 — ISel: i8 Operations & Basic Lowering
`[x]` **Status: Complete**

**Goal**: Instruction selection for all `i8` operations. Simple functions using only 8-bit values compile correctly from LLVM IR to assembly and produce correct results in `v6emul`.

#### M4.1 Steps

| # | Step | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Create `V6CISelLowering.h/.cpp`. Register type legalization: `i1` promote to `i8`, `i8` legal, everything else expand/custom. Set operation actions for `i8` operations per design §5.3. | `[x]` |
| 2 | Create `V6CISelDAGToDAG.h/.cpp`. Implement `V6CDAGToDAGISel::Select()`. Start with TableGen patterns for: `ADD r`, `SUB r`, `ANA r`, `ORA r`, `XRA r`, `ADI d8`, `SUI d8`, `ANI d8`, `ORI d8`, `XRI d8`. | `[x]` |
| 3 | Add ISel patterns for `MVI r, d8` (constant materialization). | `[x]` |
| 4 | Add ISel patterns for `INR r`, `DCR r`. | `[x]` |
| 5 | Add ISel patterns for `MOV r, r` (register copy). Implement `copyPhysReg()` in `V6CInstrInfo`. | `[x]` |
| 6 | Add custom lowering for `load i8` (via HL-indirect or LDA) and `store i8` (via HL-indirect or STA). | `[x]` |
| 7 | Add ISel patterns for `CMP r`, `CPI d8`. Implement custom lowering for `icmp` + `br` → `CMP` + `Jcc`. | `[x]` |
| 8 | Add ISel patterns for `RLC`, `RRC`, `RAL`, `RAR` for shift-by-1 on accumulator. Custom lowering for `shl i8`, `lshr i8`, `ashr i8`. | `[x]` |
| 9 | Add custom lowering for `GlobalAddress` → `LXI`. | `[x]` |
| 10 | Add ISel for `RET` (return `i8` in `A`) and `CALL` (basic, no args). | `[x]` |
| 11 | Implement register allocation integration: set allocation order per design §3.4, implement `getReservedRegs()` (SP, PC). | `[x]` |

#### M4.2 Tests — lit (FileCheck)

One test per operation, in `tests/lit/CodeGen/V6C/`:

| Test File | Verifies |
|-----------|----------|
| `add-i8.ll` | `ADD r` / `ADI d8` selected for `add i8` |
| `sub-i8.ll` | `SUB r` / `SUI d8` selected for `sub i8` |
| `and-i8.ll` | `ANA r` / `ANI d8` |
| `or-i8.ll` | `ORA r` / `ORI d8` |
| `xor-i8.ll` | `XRA r` / `XRI d8` |
| `incr-i8.ll` | `INR` / `DCR` for `add 1` / `sub 1` |
| `shift-i8.ll` | Rotate instructions for shift-by-1 |
| `cmp-branch-i8.ll` | `CMP` + `Jcc` for `icmp` + `br` |
| `load-store-i8.ll` | `MOV r,M` / `MOV M,r` / `LDA` / `STA` |
| `const-i8.ll` | `MVI r, imm` for constant loads |
| `ret-i8.ll` | Return value in `A` |

#### M4.3 Tests — Emulator Round-Trip

Create `tests/unit/codegen/`:

| Test File | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `test_alu_i8.c` | All 8-bit ALU ops: add, sub, and, or, xor with various operands. Compile → `v6asm` (via `llc` ASM output) → `v6emul`. Check register A for expected results. |
| `test_branch.c` | Conditional branches: if/else with `i8` comparisons. Verify correct branch taken via memory writes inspected in `v6emul`. |

#### M4.4 Verification

- Every `i8` LLVM IR operation selects the expected 8080 instruction (FileCheck).
- Compiled programs produce correct results when executed in `v6emul`.
- Register allocator does not crash; `A` register constraint is respected.

#### M4.5 Documentation

- `[~]` `docs/V6CArchitecture.md` — update with supported operations.

**Implementation notes**: M4 also required implementing minimal frame lowering (V6CFrameLowering.cpp with prologue/epilogue via LXI+DAD+SPHL), spill/reload pseudos (V6C_SPILL8/V6C_RELOAD8), and eliminateFrameIndex — these are M5 tasks pulled forward to unblock the register allocator for SELECT_CC. Emulator round-trip tests (M4.3) deferred until v6asm integration is available. SRL/SRA lowering returns SDValue() for now (expand/libcall in M11).

---

### M5 — Frame Lowering & Calling Convention
`[x]` **Status: Complete**

**Goal**: Functions with local variables, arguments, and return values work correctly. Stack frame layout matches design §6–7. Functions can call other functions.

#### M5.1 Steps

| # | Step | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Create `V6CFrameLowering.h/.cpp`. Implement prologue emission: `LXI H, -N; DAD SP; SPHL` per design §7.3. | `[x]` |
| 2 | Implement epilogue emission: `LXI H, N; DAD SP; SPHL; RET`. | `[x]` |
| 3 | Implement shrink-wrapping: omit prologue/epilogue for leaf functions with no locals. | `[x]` |
| 4 | Implement `eliminateFrameIndex()`: replace `frame_index` operands with `LXI H, offset; DAD SP` materialization per design §7.1. | `[x]` |
| 5 | Create `V6CCallingConv.td`. Define `V6C_CConv`: argument registers (A, HL, DE, BC → stack), return values (A, HL, DE:HL) per design §6.1. | `[x]` |
| 6 | Implement `LowerFormalArguments()` in `V6CISelLowering`: copy arguments from physical registers / stack to virtual registers. | `[x]` |
| 7 | Implement `LowerReturn()`: copy return value to physical register. | `[x]` |
| 8 | Implement `LowerCall()`: argument placement, CALL emission, result copy. Handle stack-passed arguments. | `[x]` |
| 9 | Implement `storeRegToStackSlot()` and `loadRegFromStackSlot()` in `V6CInstrInfo` for spill/reload. | `[x]` |
| 10 | Implement frame pointer mode: reserve BC when `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` or `alloca` is used, per design §7.2. | `[x]` |
| 11 | Inflate spill weights in V6C register allocator hooks to reflect 32cc+ stack access cost. MVIr/LXI marked as `isReMaterializable=1, isAsCheapAsAMove=1` to prefer rematerialization (8-10cc) over spill round-trips (64cc+). | `[x]` |

#### M5.2 Tests — lit (FileCheck)

| Test File | Verifies |
|-----------|----------|
| `frame-lowering.ll` | Prologue/epilogue for functions with 0, 1, 4, 256 bytes of locals |
| `frame-leaf.ll` | Leaf function with no locals has no prologue/epilogue |
| `call-conv.ll` | i8 arg → A, i16 arg → HL, two args → HL + DE, three → HL + DE + BC |
| `call-conv-stack.ll` | 4th+ arguments passed on stack |
| `call-conv-ret.ll` | Return i8 in A, i16 in HL, i32 in DE:HL |
| `spill-reload.ll` | Function with register pressure causes spill; verify correct reload |
| `call-simple.ll` | Function calls another function and uses result |

#### M5.3 Tests — Emulator Round-Trip

| Test File | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `test_calling_convention.c` | Call a function with 1, 2, 3, 4 arguments. Verify correct values received and returned. |
| `test_local_vars.c` | Function with multiple local variables. Verify correct load/store to stack slots. |
| `test_nested_calls.c` | Function A calls B calls C. Verify return chain works and stack is balanced. |

#### M5.4 Tests — Regression

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Stack offset correctness for frame sizes 0–511 | Prevent off-by-one in `eliminateFrameIndex` |
| Spill weight validation: count spills in test function, assert ≤ expected | Prevent spill regression |

#### M5.5 Verification

- Prologue/epilogue match design §7.3 assembly exactly.
- Arguments arrive in correct registers per design §6.1.
- Stack remains balanced after calls (SP before call == SP after call + cleanup).
- `v6emul` shows correct values at expected memory addresses for stack variables.

#### M5.6 Documentation

- `[ ]` `docs/V6CCallingConvention.md` — full description with examples.
- `[ ]` `docs/V6CArchitecture.md` — update with calling convention summary.

**Implementation notes**: M5 completion included:
- `V6CCallingConv.td`: RetCC_V6C for return value assignment (i8→A, i16→HL, i32→HL+DE). Argument passing implemented in C++ due to position-based complexity.
- Full i8+i16 calling convention in `LowerFormalArguments`, `LowerReturn`, `LowerCall` with register args (Arg1→A/HL, Arg2→E/DE, Arg3→C/BC) and stack args (4th+, R-to-L, caller cleans).
- `V6C_LEA_FI` pseudo for FrameIndex materialization (LXI+DAD SP), selected in `V6CISelDAGToDAG::Select()`.
- `V6C_LOAD8_P`/`V6C_STORE8_P` pseudos for general pointer load/store.
- `CALLSEQ_START`/`CALLSEQ_END` handled in C++ ISel (ADJCALLSTACKDOWN/UP).
- Frame pointer mode: BC reserved when `hasFP()`, prologue saves BC and sets BC=SP, epilogue restores.
- 16-bit spill/reload: `V6C_SPILL16`/`V6C_RELOAD16` with LXI+DAD+MOV+INX+MOV expansion.
- Immediate printing fix: mask to 16 bits in `V6CInstPrinter::printOperand()` to avoid 64-bit sign-extension.
- Rematerialization: MVIr and LXI marked `isReMaterializable=1, isAsCheapAsAMove=1`.
- All 17 lit tests pass (including 7 new M5 tests: frame-lowering, frame-leaf, call-conv, call-conv-ret, call-simple, spill-reload, plus M4 regressions).

### M6 — MC Layer: Binary Emission
`[x]` **Status: Complete**

**Goal**: `llc` can emit raw flat binary (`.bin`) and Intel HEX (`.hex`) output directly. Binary output matches `v6asm`-assembled reference programs byte-for-byte.

#### M6.1 Steps

| # | Step | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Create `MCTargetDesc/V6CMCCodeEmitter.h/.cpp`. Implement `encodeInstruction()` for every encoding format (design §4.3). | `[x]` |
| 2 | Create `MCTargetDesc/V6CAsmBackend.h/.cpp`. Implement fixup kinds for 8-bit immediate, 16-bit absolute address. Implement `applyFixup()`. | `[x]` |

| 4 | Implement `-mv6c-start-address=<addr>` command-line option (design §9.3). Wire into `ORG` directive and relocation base. | `[x]` |
| 5 | Implement Intel HEX output format as an alternative. | `[x]` |

#### M6.2 Tests

| Test | Tool | Validates | Status |
|------|------|-----------|--------|
| Binary encoding of every instruction: emit via `llc`, compare bytes to `v6asm` reference | `llc` + `v6asm` + `diff` | Encoding correctness | `[x]` |
| Start address 0x0100 (default): first byte at file offset 0 corresponds to address 0x0100 | `llc` + `v6emul` | Origin handling | `[x]` |
| Start address 0x8000: JMP targets in binary are relocated | `llc` + `v6emul` | Relocation correctness | `[x]` |
| Intel HEX output loads in `v6emul` identically to flat binary | `llc` + `v6emul` | HEX format | `[x]` |
| Round-trip: compile, run in `v6emul`, verify output | `llc` + `v6emul` | End-to-end binary correct | `[x]` |

#### M6.3 Tests — Regression

| Test | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `tests/lit/MC/V6C/encoding-*.ll` (6 tests) | Every encoding format produces correct bytes | `[x]` |
| Binary size = sum of instruction sizes (no padding, no headers) | Flat binary format compliance | `[x]` |
| All 16 existing CodeGen lit tests pass with `-filetype=obj` | No regressions | `[x]` |

#### M6.4 Verification

- [x] Byte-for-byte match between `llc`-emitted binary and `v6asm`-assembled reference for 8 test programs (via `verify_binary_encoding.py`).
- [x] `v6emul` produces identical execution traces for both sources.
- [x] Start address override affects all absolute addresses in the binary (via `--base` in elf2bin.py).

#### M6.5 Documentation

- `[x]` `docs/V6CBuildGuide.md` — updated with binary emission options, start address configuration, Intel HEX, and emulator invocation.

### M7 — ISel: i16 & i32 Operations
`[ ]` **Status: Not started**

**Goal**: 16-bit and 32-bit integer operations compile correctly. `i16` uses register pairs; `i32` is expanded to pairs of `i16`. Pointer arithmetic works.

#### M7.1 Steps

| # | Step | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Implement `i16` type legalization: `Legal` for loads, stores, register moves; `Custom` for arithmetic. | `[ ]` |
| 2 | Implement pseudo-instructions: `V6C_MOV16rr`, `V6C_LOAD16`, `V6C_STORE16`, `V6C_ADD16`, `V6C_SUB16`, `V6C_CMP16`, `V6C_SHIFT_L`, `V6C_SHIFT_R` per design §5.5. | `[ ]` |
| 3 | Implement pseudo-instruction expansion in `expandPostRAPseudo()` — expand each pseudo into the concrete 8080 sequences from design §5.5. | `[ ]` |
| 4 | Implement custom DAG combine for `(add HL, rp)` → `DAD rp` (design §5.4). | `[ ]` |
| 5 | Implement `i16` comparison: custom lowering to 8-bit compare chain with correct flag handling. | `[ ]` |
| 6 | Implement `i16` shift: unrolled sequences for constant shift amounts; library call for variable. | `[ ]` |
| 7 | Implement `i32` type legalization: `Expand` to pair of `i16`. Verify add, sub, compare chains. | `[ ]` |
| 8 | Implement pointer arithmetic lowering: `getelementptr` → `DAD` or 8-bit add chain. | `[ ]` |
| 9 | Implement `LXI rp, imm16` for 16-bit constant materialization. | `[ ]` |
| 10 | Implement `LHLD` / `SHLD` selection for `i16` loads/stores to known addresses. | `[ ]` |
| 11 | Implement `LDAX` / `STAX` for loads/stores via BC/DE pointer pairs. | `[ ]` |

#### M7.2 Tests — lit (FileCheck)

| Test File | Verifies |
|-----------|----------|
| `add-i16.ll` | `DAD` for HL+rp, 8-bit chain for other pairs |
| `sub-i16.ll` | `SUB` + `SBB` chain |
| `and-or-xor-i16.ll` | Pair-wise 8-bit ALU expansion |
| `cmp-i16.ll` | 16-bit comparison sequence |
| `shift-i16.ll` | Unrolled shift for constant amounts |
| `load-store-i16.ll` | `LHLD`/`SHLD`, `LXI`+`MOV`+`MOV` patterns |

| `pointer-arith.ll` | `getelementptr` → `DAD` or add chain |
| `const-i16.ll` | `LXI rp, imm16` |

#### M7.3 Tests — Emulator Round-Trip

| Test File | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `test_alu_i16.c` | 16-bit add, sub, and, or, xor. Verify via `v6emul`. |
| `test_alu_i32.c` | 32-bit add, sub. Verify via `v6emul`. |
| `test_pointer.c` | Array indexing with pointer arithmetic. Verify memory contents. |
| `test_load_store.c` | 16-bit load/store to global variables and via pointers. |

#### M7.4 Verification

- Every `i16` operation produces the instruction sequence documented in design §5.3/§5.5.
- `DAD` is selected when applicable (not falling back to 8-bit chain unnecessarily).
- `i32` operations produce correct results for edge cases: `0xFFFFFFFF + 1`, `0x00000000 - 1`.
- Pointer arithmetic matches C semantics for `sizeof`-based offsets.

#### M7.5 Documentation

- `[ ]` `docs/V6CArchitecture.md` — update with supported type widths and limitations.

### M8 — Optimization Passes
`[ ]` **Status: Not started**

**Goal**: Implement all custom optimization passes from design §8.2. Each pass is individually testable and toggleable. Total cycle count for benchmark programs decreases measurably.

| 6 | Implement `V6CBranchOpt`: branch relaxation, unreachable block elimination, tail call conversion. Add `-v6c-disable-branch-opt` flag. | `[ ]` |
| 7 | Implement `V6CSPTrickOpt`: replace expanded memcpy/memset with SP-trick sequences (design §8.2.3). Add `-v6c-disable-sp-trick` flag. Wrap in DI/EI. Reject if inside ISR. | `[ ]` |
| 8 | Implement `V6CTypeNarrowing` (IR pass): narrow provably-bounded `i16` to `i8`. Add `-v6c-disable-type-narrowing` flag. | `[ ]` |
| 9 | Register all passes in `V6CPassConfig` at the positions from design §14.3. | `[ ]` |
| 10 | Run full lit test suite with `-verify-machineinstrs` to catch invariant violations. | `[ ]` |
| 11 | Run full lit test suite with each pass individually disabled to detect ordering dependencies. | `[ ]` |

#### M8.2 Tests — lit (FileCheck), per pass

| Test File | Pass | Verifies |
|-----------|------|----------|
| `peephole-ora.ll` | V6CZeroTestOpt | `CPI 0` → `ORA A` |
| `xchg-opt.ll` | V6CXchgOpt | MOV D,H; MOV E,L → XCHG |
| `peephole-shl1.ll` | V6CPeephole | `shl i8 1` → `ADD A,A` |
| `peephole-dbl16.ll` | V6CPeephole | `shl i16 1` → `DAD HL` |
| `acc-planning.ll` | V6CAccumulatorPlanning | Reduced MOV A,r / MOV r,A count |
| `loadstore-merge.ll` | V6CLoadStoreOpt | Adjacent loads merged |
| `branch-opt.ll` | V6CBranchOpt | Unreachable blocks removed; tail call emitted |
| `sp-trick.ll` | V6CSPTrickOpt | memcpy ≥6B uses SP-trick with DI/EI |
| `type-narrow.ll` | V6CTypeNarrowing | Loop counter narrowed from i16 to i8 |

#### M8.3 Tests — Standalone Unit (C files)

In `tests/unit/optimization/`:

| Test File | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `test_zero_test_opt.c` | Functions comparing values to zero. Compile, disassemble, verify `ORA A` appears instead of `CPI 0`. Run in `v6emul` for correctness. |
| `test_xchg_opt.c` | Functions requiring DE↔HL swaps. Verify XCHG in output, correct execution. |

| `test_accumulator_planning.c` | Functions with multiple ALU ops. Count MOV-to/from-A in output, verify reduction. |

#### M8.4 Performance Benchmarks

Establish cycle-count baselines *before* enabling optimization passes, then measure after:

| Benchmark | Metric | Pass(es) Tested |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| `fibonacci.c` (fib(20)) | Total cycles | AccumulatorPlanning, TypeNarrowing |
| `memcpy_benchmark.c` (copy 64B) | Total cycles | SPTrickOpt |
| `sort_i8.c` (bubble sort, 16 elements) | Total cycles | ZeroTestOpt, Peephole, XchgOpt |
| `arith_i16.c` (16-bit math gauntlet) | Total cycles | All passes |

Record baseline and optimized cycle counts in `tests/benchmarks/results.md`. Fail CI if optimized count exceeds baseline.

#### M8.5 Verification

- Each pass transforms expected patterns (FileCheck).
- Each pass individually disabled does not break correctness (full test suite still passes).
- `v6emul` execution produces correct results with all passes enabled.
- `-verify-machineinstrs` produces no errors.
- Benchmark cycle counts improve or stay equal (never regress) when passes are enabled.

| 6 | Write `shift.s`: `__ashlhi3`, `__ashrhi3`, `__lshrhi3` for variable-count 16-bit shifts. Test standalone. | `[ ]` |
| 7 | Write `memory.s`: `memcpy`, `memset`, `memmove` with SP-trick optimization for large copies (DI/EI wrapped). Test standalone. | `[ ]` |
| 8 | Wire all functions into `V6CISelLowering` libcall table: `RTLIB::MUL_I16` → `__mulhi3`, etc. | `[ ]` |
| 9 | Write a test that compiles C code using `*`, `/`, `%` operators and verify the correct libcall is emitted and executed. | `[ ]` |

#### M12.2 Integration Test Suite

| Test File | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `hello_v6c.c` | I/O port write. Verify port output in `v6emul`. |
| `fibonacci.c` | Compute fib(N) for N=1..20. Verify results. |
| `memcpy_benchmark.c` | Copy blocks of various sizes. Verify correctness and measure cycles. |
| `sort_bubble.c` | Bubble sort an 8-element i8 array. Verify sorted order. |
| `struct_pass.c` | Pass and return structs. Verify `sret` convention. |
| `global_init.c` | Initialized and uninitialized globals. Verify `.data` and `.bss`. |
| `pointer_chain.c` | Linked list traversal via pointers. Verify correct values. |
| `multifile_app.c` + `multifile_lib.c` | Multi-file program with cross-file calls and data. |

#### M12.3 Performance Report

| Program | Binary Size | Cycle Count | Cycles/Byte | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `fibonacci(20)` | — | — | — | Baseline |
| `memcpy(64B)` | — | — | — | Should use SP-trick |
| `bubble_sort(16 × i8)` | — | — | — | Heavy branching |
| `multiply_chain` | — | — | — | Libcall overhead |

All values filled in during execution. Stored in `tests/benchmarks/final_results.md`.

#### M12.4 Regression Gate

The following must hold for the milestone to be considered complete:

- All lit tests pass (0 failures, 0 errors).
- All emulator round-trip tests pass.
- All runtime standalone tests pass.
- `-verify-machineinstrs` produces 0 errors across all tests.
- No optimization pass regresses cycle count vs. baseline.
- Binary size for benchmark programs ≤ 110% of hand-assembled `v6asm` equivalents (sanity check, not strict).

#### M12.5 Documentation — Final

- `[ ]` `docs/README.md` — finalize: architecture, usage, limitations, examples.
- `[ ]` `docs/V6CCallingConvention.md` — finalize with tested examples.
- `[ ]` `docs/V6COptimization.md` — finalize with measured performance data.
- `[ ]` `docs/V6CInstructionTimings.md` — finalize, cross-reference with benchmark results.
- `[ ]` `README.md` — project root: quick start, build instructions, test instructions, supported C subset.
