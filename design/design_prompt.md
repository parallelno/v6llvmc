Develop a professional design document for a custom LLVM backend for the Vector 06c (Intel 8080 (8-bit) compatible machine).

Key Technical Requirements:
The target system has a 64KB flat memory model.
Intel 8080 (8-bit) CPU with specific Vector 06c instruction timings.

| Instruction  | Note |
|-------------|------|
| MOV r,r      | Twice slower than ALU ops — makes register shuffling costlier |
| MVI r,n      | Nearly free difference vs MOV |
| INR/DCR r    | Same cost as MOV on V6C |
| INX/DCX rp   | Same cost as INR on V6C |
| ADD/SUB/AND/OR/XOR r | ALU ops are the cheapest class |
| ADI/SUI/ANI/ORI/XRI n | Immediate ALU ties with reg MVI |
| DAD rp       | Relatively cheap 16-bit add |
| LXI rp,nn    | Same cost as DAD |
| MOV r,M / MOV M,r | Memory access = register move cost |
| LDA/STA addr | Low Direct memory = 2× MOV cost |
| LHLD/SHLD    | Slower then Push/Pop |
| PUSH rp      | Cheap for memcpy, memset, etc — critical for SP-based tricks |
| POP rp       | Cheap |
| XCHG         | Free — same as ALU op |
| ORA r        | Preferred over CPI 0 (saves 4cc) |
| RRC, RAR, RLC, RAL | cheapest ALU ops. Great for bits manipulation |

The default starting execution address is 0x100, but the compiler must provide an option to set any arbitrary address in a range of available RAM (64K).

Frontend: It's your choice. It can be existing frontend that provides minimal C support or Clang as your frontend to parse C and generate the initial LLVM IR, which your new backend will then transform into 8080 machine code.
Optimization: Because 8-bit registers are scarce, lean heavily on LLVM's optimization passes to minimize memory access and register pressure.

Act as an experienced software architect.
Create a high-level design for a complex software project that prioritizes modularity, robustness, maintainability, documentation quality, and test coverage.
Limit the output to design concepts, architectural decisions, and interfaces.
Do not include implementation details or step-by-step development instructions.
