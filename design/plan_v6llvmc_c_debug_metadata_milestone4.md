# Plan: C Debug Metadata Milestone 4 - Optimized Lifetimes and Location Lists

**Status:** Proposed
**Depends on:** Milestones 1-3
**Optimization levels:** `-O1`, `-O2`, `-Os`, and project-default optimized builds

## 1. Problem

### Current behavior

At optimized levels V6C may retain parameter/local DIEs but emits no useful
`DW_AT_location` for them. Custom pre/post-RA passes erase, clone, move, and
replace machine instructions without a systematic `DBG_VALUE` or
`DBG_INSTR_REF` preservation policy. Values move through registers, ordinary
spills, static slots, constants, and O61 self-modifying immediate bytes.

### Desired behavior

Final ELFs must contain accurate `.debug_loclists` transitions and gaps for
recoverable optimized values. All existing optimizations remain enabled and
retain their exact code-quality behavior.

### Root cause

V6C transformations use non-debug use queries and instruction rewrites but do
not consistently salvage, transfer, or terminate associated debug values.

## 2. Strategy

### Approach: audit transformations by value effect, not pass name

Build a pass matrix describing each rewrite's value-preserving, value-moving,
value-defining, or value-killing semantics. Update debug records beside the
rewrite using generic LLVM helpers where possible. Test each pass independently
and then test composed post-RA pipelines. Describe O61 reload immediates at
their real code addresses rather than disabling O61.

### Why this works

Debug metadata becomes a truthful observer of the already-optimized machine
program. Optimization matching, profitability, and emitted instructions stay
unchanged, while locations follow surviving values and end at clobbers.

### Summary of changes

- Audit every V6C IR and MachineFunction transformation affecting values.
- Preserve/salvage machine debug records for copies, folds, spills, reloads,
  constants, dead values, and CFG rewrites.
- Emit v5 location lists with transitions, disjoint ranges, and gaps.
- Model static-stack and O61 instruction-byte locations accurately.

## 3. Implementation Steps

### Step 3.1 - Read references, inventory passes, and capture baselines [ ]

Review generic LiveDebugValues/debug-instr-ref support and every active V6C IR,
pre-RA, post-RA, PEI, and pre-emit pass. Record an inventory of instruction
mutation APIs and debug handling. Capture benchmark and executable baselines.

> **Implementation Notes**:

### Step 3.2 - Define the machine debug preservation policy [ ]

For erase/replace/move/clone/fold/CFG cases, specify when to transfer a debug
instruction number, substitute a debug operand, emit a new debug value, or end
a location. Adopt one consistent generic LLVM representation supported by the
pinned LLVM version.

> **Implementation Notes**:

### Step 3.3 - Repair pre-RA and CFG transformations [ ]

Update constant sinking, dead-PHI constant replacement, custom inserters, and
other pre-RA/CFG rewrites so debug uses and scopes follow the new definitions
and edges without changing optimization eligibility or generated code.

> **Implementation Notes**:

### Step 3.4 - Repair spill and frame transformations [ ]

Handle spill forwarding, dead reloads, ordinary/static spill expansion,
frame-index elimination, and register-to-stack-to-register transitions. Emit
gaps where no recoverable machine value exists.

> **Implementation Notes**:

### Step 3.5 - Repair all pre-emit optimizations [ ]

Audit accumulator planning, load-immediate combine, peephole, load/store,
XCHG, branch, zero-test, register-value forwarding, redundant flags, and SP
tricks. Preserve debug semantics without altering any pattern, cost, liveness
decision, or output instruction.

> **Implementation Notes**:

### Step 3.6 - Model O61 patched locations [ ]

For patched LXI/MVI reloads, describe the live value in the destination
register after execution and, where a memory location is valid, the actual
`.LLo61_N+1` instruction-byte address. Terminate locations when later patches
or clobbers invalidate them. Do not disable, delete, or special-case O61 out of
debug builds.

> **Implementation Notes**:

### Step 3.7 - Build [ ]

Run `pwsh scripts/build.ps1 -SkipTests`.

> **Implementation Notes**:

### Step 3.8 - Add pass-specific and location-list tests [ ]

Add IR/MIR tests for every audited mutation class and final ELF tests for
register moves, spill/reload transitions, constants, gaps, prologue/epilogue,
disjoint ranges, half-open boundaries, static slots, O61 patches, calls, and
optimized-out values at `-O1/-O2/-Os`.

> **Implementation Notes**:

### Step 3.9 - Add emulator lifetime tests [ ]

Stop on both sides of each transition and evaluate the selected location
against registers/memory. Assert unavailable ranges remain unavailable and
shadowed identities do not alias.

> **Implementation Notes**:

### Step 3.10 - Prove optimization and performance non-regression [ ]

All optimizations and their default settings remain active. Compare `-g0`
assembly, `.text`, ROM, optimization remarks where practical, and benchmark
cycles/sizes to baseline. Compare optimized `-g` executable bytes to matching
`-g0`. Any instruction, cycle, or size regression blocks completion.

> **Implementation Notes**:

### Step 3.11 - Run regression tests [ ]

Run all focused tests and `python tests/run_all.py` with benchmarks enabled.

> **Implementation Notes**:

### Step 3.12 - Verify assembly and create `result.txt` [ ]

Include unchanged assembly, selected `.debug_loclists` dumps, transition/value
checks, pass coverage matrix, and complete benchmark comparison.

> **Implementation Notes**:

### Step 3.13 - Document, sync, and mark complete [ ]

Publish optimized-location guarantees and limitations, sync mirrors, and mark
all steps plus the master milestone complete.

> **Implementation Notes**:

## 4. Expected Results

- Optimized parameters/locals have accurate transitions or honest gaps.
- Static-stack and O61 remain enabled and debuggable.
- Optimized executable bytes and all benchmark results remain unchanged.

## 5. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| A debug fix changes optimization decisions | Keep debug records excluded from semantic use counts and require byte identity. |
| Stale location survives a fold | Test before/after every audited rewrite and clobber. |
| O61 code bytes are mistaken for immutable memory | Track patch lifetime and use final linked symbol addresses. |
| Audit misses a pass | Maintain a checked pass inventory derived from the actual pipeline. |

## 6. Relationship to Other Improvements

This milestone integrates debug tracking with all existing V6C optimization
passes; it does not supersede or modify their performance goals.

## 7. Future Enhancements

`DW_OP_piece` and entry values remain optional until producer and consumer
contracts explicitly enable them.
